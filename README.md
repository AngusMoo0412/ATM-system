This is a 5 people group project of SEHH2242 Object Oriented Programming from HKCC.

ATM System
- Designed and implemented a fully functional ATM simulation system using Java and Swing GUI, incorporating key banking operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, and fund transfers between accounts.
- Developed secure authentication mechanisms including PIN validation and account verification, ensuring proper user authentication before allowing access to account features and transactions.
- Created a modular object-oriented architecture with classes for Account (including Cheque and Savings account types), Transaction processing, Bank Database, and GUI components (Screen, Keypad), demonstrating strong OOP principles.
- Implemented a graphical user interface with custom components including a secure password input field, transaction screens, and responsive keypad, providing an intuitive user experience that mimics real ATM operations.

- Use BlueJ to open the project
